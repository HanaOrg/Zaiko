### What is it

An app for simple inventory management, oriented for small businesses and so. It's very basic, but it gets the job done and weights less than 10 MB. Plus, there are plans to slowly improve it over time.

### Features

- Very easy installation.
- Simple inventory, create SETs that wrap ITEMs of any kind.
- View stock for all items, and warnings for items running out of stock.
- Update stock for all items from your homepage.
- Export data to Excel, JSON, or CSV files.
- Add barcodes for your items and easily export them as PNG.
  - You can also generate (internal only) barcodes from the app.

### Contributing

The app is written in TypeScript using BunJS and Tauri, so you'll need to install that.

Contributing is simple, just fork this repo, write some code you've tested to ensure it doesn't crash, and open a Pull Request.
